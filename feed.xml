                <p>Thank you for coming to my website. I appreciate that you took the time to read something that could be meaningless (yet entertraining) or useful in your everyday lives.</p>
<p>Remember the butterfly effect (Chaos Theory): Something as small as the flutter of a butterfly's wings, can ultimately cause a typhoon halfway across the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is my attempt to have some sort of positive energy sent out to our virtual world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enjoy!&nbsp;</p>
