Those combinations of words don&rsquo;t last forever, but ugly words and phrases linger in the vocabulary.

This will give some reflection for the 2018 year and give me, and maybe you, a chance to reflect change. Even if we don't like it, outside influences are constantly changing our perspective and personality. It's how we adjust to those changes that will reflect our character. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
